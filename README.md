# Incremental Principal Component Analysis Variants
Incremental PCA variants for face recognition are among the most researched topic that provide a great advantage with dynamic data and are hence useful in fields such as face recognition where data is constantly change from time to time. In this project we have implemented two different methods of Incremental PCA variants available in the literature.

Additionally we have used face datasets publicly available such as AR, CACD, Yale B which are among the most popular face datasets and are highly versatile covering several face variations such as Pose variations, Expression variations, Illumination variation as well as Partial Occlusions.
